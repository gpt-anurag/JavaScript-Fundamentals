// --> 3.5 Automated testing with Mocha
// --> Behaviour Driven Development (BDD). BDD is three things in one: tests, documentation, and examples.

// --> Before creating the function of pow, we can imagine what the function should do and describe it. Such description is called specification or spec.

// describe("pow", function () {
//   it("raises to n-th power", function () {
//     assert.equal(pow(2, 3), 8);
//   });
// });

// --> Link to check the development flow of automated testing
// --> Mocha is the core framework that provides common testing functions including describe and it and the main functions that runs tests.
// --> Chai is library with many assertions.
// --> Sinon is the library to spy over functions, emulate build-in functions and more, we'll need it much later.
